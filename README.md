# Draw Names

The holdiays are approaching and who doesn't love a good secret santa gift exchange? But what are you to do when you need to draw names while  all the participants (family, friends, or co-workers) are strewn across the country. The answer is here at last!

Simply provide the function with a list of names, and it will match each participant with a secret santa. It saves the matches in `.txt` files in the `./drawn-names` folder, so each match is secret. Each file bears the name of the only individual who should open and read the file.
